Purpose:

This is a multi semester project inspired by a NSF/NSA grant funded research study conducted in partnership with Texas A&M University San Antonio. By completing this project, you will be able to create a program totally designed by yourself and can add it to your professional portfolio. Every student can continue to improve on their project each semester and even after you completed your studies at San Antonio College. Since you have chosen your own unique project, everyone's project will be able to stand out and impress future employers.

You are the CEO of a new and upcoming company. You will be doing a live demo in front of a panel of investors with  lots of money. Based on how well you can pitch your amazing program, you will receive up to 100 thousand dollars to fund your project. Even if you do not get the entire 100 K, they are willing to give partial funding for successfully accomplishing major milestones (ie. providing design documents, spellchecked slide show, sales pitch video).
