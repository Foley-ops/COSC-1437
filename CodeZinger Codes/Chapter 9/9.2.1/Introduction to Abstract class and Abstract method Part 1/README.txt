Given an integer N, create an Abstract class “Shape” with an abstract method “printArea” that accepts integer parameter and has return type void.

Also, create a “Square” class inherited from “Shape” class which implements a “printArea” method to print the area of the square (Area of Square = N2).

Input
    50

Output
    2500

Assume that,

N is an integer within the range [1 to 1000000].
